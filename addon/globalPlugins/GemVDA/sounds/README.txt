Sound Files for Gemini NVDA Add-on
===================================

Place the following WAV files in this directory:

1. chatRequestSent.wav    - Played when a message is sent to Gemini
2. chatResponsePending.wav - Played while waiting for response (loops)
3. chatResponseReceived.wav - Played when response is received
4. progress.wav           - General progress indicator

These sounds provide audio feedback to users.
You can use any short WAV files (recommended: 0.5-2 seconds).

If sounds are not present, the add-on will still work but without audio feedback.
